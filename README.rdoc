* http://github.com/bscofield/sortable

== DESCRIPTION:

Sortable provides a DSL for defining sort order on any Ruby object

To use it, you just call the sortable method and pass it a list of methods and/or blocks; when
you call sort on a collection of these objects, each method/block is evaluated in turn, and the 
first that provides a non-zero sort value is used.

== EXAMPLE:

  require 'sortable'
  
  class Book
    include Sortable

    attr_accessor :author, :title
    
    sortable :author, lambda {|book| book.title.sub(/^(The|A|An) /, '')}
    
    def initialize(author, title)
      self.author = author
      self.title  = title
    end
  end
  
  fforde  = Book.new('Fforde', 'Something Rotten')
  stroud1 = Book.new('Stroud', 'The Golem\'s Eye')
  stroud2 = Book.new('Stroud', 'The Amulet of Samarkand')
  colfer  = Book.new('Colfer', 'Artemis Fowl')
  
  [fforde, stroud1, stroud2, colfer].sort #=> colfer, fforde, stroud2, stroud1
